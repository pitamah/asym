                you believe that your copyrighted work has
                been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement and is accessible on this site, you may
                notify our designated copyright agent, as set
                forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (DMCA) (such act may be found on the U.S.
                Copyright Office website at
                http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf. Upon receipt of such notice as described below, we will
                take whatever action, in our sole discretion,
                we deem appropriate, including removal of the challenged content from the web site or any Service. For
                your complaint to be valid under the DMCA,
                you must provide us with the following information when providing notice of the claimed copyright
                infringement: </p>
              <p> 1. Identify the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed (or a preventative list of the
                copyrighted works - if multiple copyrighted
                works are the subject matter of such notice). </p>
              <p> 2. Identify the material or link you claim is infringing (or the subject of infringing activity) and
                that is to be removed. </p>
              <p> 3. Include the following statements: <br>a. “I hereby state that I have a good faith belief that the
                disputed use of the copyrighted material
                is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.” <br>b. “I hereby state that the
                information in this notice is accurate and,
                under penalty of perjury, that I am the owner, or authorized to act on behalf of, the owner, of the
                copyright or of an exclusive right under
                the copyright that is allegedly infringed.” <br>4. Provide your company affiliation (if applicable),
                mailing address, telephone number, and,
                if available, email address. <br>5. Provide your full legal name and your electronic or physical
                signature. If you believe in good faith that
                a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed by Asymmetrical.ai against you, the </p>

                content or cease disabling it in ten
                business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against Asymmetrical.ai
                or the person who has posted allegedly
                infringing content, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in ten business days
                or more after receipt of the Counter-Notice. </p>
              <p> Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see

                applicable, shall be borne and paid by you. For the
                avoidance of doubt, you shall not be responsible for any payment of taxes based on Company's net income.

                “as available” basis. To the fullest
                extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, we, our service providers, agents, and sub-contractors
                disclaim all warranties of any kind,
                express or implied, including, without limitation, implied warranties of title, non-infringement,

                particular purpose. </p>

                will be corrected. </p>
              <p> The foregoing exclusions and disclaimers are an essential part of these terms and formed the basis for
                determining the price charged for
                the service. Some states do not allow exclusion of an implied warranty, so this disclaimer may not apply
                to you. Your sole and exclusive
                remedy for any failure or nonperformance of the service shall be for Asymmetrical.ai to use commercially

                damages for loss of business, loss of goodwill, loss of data, lost profits or other intangible losses),

                contract, negligence, strict liability, breach of any statutory duty, or otherwise arising out of or
                relating in any way to the service
                (even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if a remedy fails of its
                essential purpose). Some jurisdictions
                may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so some
                of the above may not apply to you.
                In such jurisdictions, liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law. You further agree
                that we shall have no responsibility
                for any damages suffered by you in connection with loss of data, errors, system down time, network or
                system outages, communications line failure,
                file corruption, or service interruptions caused by the negligence of either us or our sub-contractors
                and service providers, all in irrespective
                of the theory upon which any claim may be based, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such
                damages. </p>
              <p> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, our liability to you or any other party for
                any cause whatsoever and regardless
                of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to the amounts paid by you to us for the
                services provided during the three (3) months
                preceding the circumstances first giving rise to the claim of liability. </p>

              <h5 class="sub-title">12. MISCELLANEOUS</h5>
              <p> No waiver by Company of any default shall be deemed a waiver of any prior or subsequent default of the
                same or other provisions of these
                Terms, nor shall any delay or omission on the part of Company to exercise or avail itself of any right
                or remedy that it has or may have
                hereunder operate as a waiver of any right or remedy. If any provision hereof is held invalid or
                unenforceable by a court of competent
                jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect the validity or operation of any other provision and such
                invalid provision shall be
                deemed to be severed from these Terms. We may freely assign our rights and responsibilities hereunder
                without notice to you.
                These Terms are not assignable, transferable or sublicenseable by you except with our prior written
                consent. </p>
              <p> These Terms are a contract between you and the Company. The Terms constitute the entire understandings
                between you and us, and revoke
                and supersede all prior agreements between us, and are intended as a final expression of our agreement.
                These Terms shall take precedence
                over any other documents that may be in conflict therewith. Any heading, caption or section title
                contained in these Terms is inserted
                only as a matter of convenience and in no way defines or explains any section or provision hereof. We
                reserve the right at any time to
                modify these Terms. Any such modification will be effective immediately upon notice to you (or if
                otherwise stated in the notice),
                which we may provide by any means including, without limitation, posting the amended Terms on our
                website or by sending an electronic mail to you.
                Your continued use of the Service after the effective date of any such modifications will be deemed
                acceptance of such modified Terms. </p>
              <p> These Terms shall be construed in accordance with and governed for all purposes by the substantive
                laws of the State of Israel without
                regard to its conflicts of law provisions. You agree that any claim or dispute you may have against the
                Company and its affiliates, directors,
                officers, employees and representatives must be resolved by a court located in London, UK, and waive any
                jurisdictional, venue or inconvenient
                forum objections to such courts. </p>
