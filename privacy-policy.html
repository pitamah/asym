              <h5 class="sub-title">I. What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h5>
              <p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally
                identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our
                Services. This
                policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals
                that we do not
                employ or manage. </p>
              <p> If you are not of legal age to form a binding contract (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18), you
                may only use
                the Services and disclose information to us with your parent's or legal guardian's express consent.
                Review this
                Privacy Policy with your parent or legal guardian to make sure you understand it. </p>
              <p> We only collect Personal Information through the Services from a child under 13 where that student's
                school,
                district, and/or teacher has agreed (via the terms described in the Terms of Use) to obtain parental
                consent for
                that child to use the Services and disclose Personal Information to us or where the parent or legal
                guardian of a
                child has signed up or been invited to sign up or approve the child to use the Services. If you are a
                student under
                13, please do not send any Personal Information about yourself to us if your school, district, and/or
                teacher has
                not obtained this prior consent from your parent or guardian or if your parent or guardian has not
                signed you up and
                given their approval for you to use the Service, and please do not send any Personal Information other
                than what we
                request from you in connection with the Services. If we learn we have collected Personal Information
                from a student
                under 13 without parental consent being obtained by his or her parent, guardian, school, district,
                and/or teacher,
                or if we learn a student under 13 has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him
                or her, we
                will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student under 13 may have
                provided us
                personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at <a
                  href="mailto:hello@Asymmetrical.ai">hello@Asymmetrical.ai</a>. </p>
              <p> When we use the term “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are referring to personally
                identifiable
                information of individual, non-children (i.e., adult) registrants of the Services. References to
                “Children's
                Personal Information” only apply to personally identifiable information collected from users who have
                registered for
                the Services as minor students (i.e., students under the age of 13). General references to “information”
                apply to
                all users. </p>
              <p> We gather various types of Personal Information and Children's Personal Information from our users, as
                explained
                more fully below. We may use this Personal Information and Children's Personal Information to
                personalize and
                improve our services, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile, to contact users, to
                fulfill your
                requests for certain products and services, to analyze how users utilize the Services, and as otherwise
                set forth in
                this Privacy Policy. We may share certain types of Personal Information and Children's Personal
                Information with
                third parties, as described below. </p>
              <h5 class="sub-title">II. What Information Does Asymmetrical.ai Collect?</h5>
              <h6>A. Information You Provide to Us:</h6>
              <p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, we collect Personal
              Information and Children's
              Personal Information, such as your name, email address, school affiliation and a picture (if provided). If
              you are a
              student registrant (i.e., you sign up as a student under the age of 13), the only Children's Personal
              Information we
              require is your parent's email address so we can initiate a parental consent process, as well as
              non-personal
              information such as your screen name and password. Once you are signed up with parental activation, you
              may also be
              permitted to create a profile avatar through the functionality of the Services. If you provide your
              third-party
              account login credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third
              Party
              Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions,
              and that
              Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy. You can
              choose not to
              provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage
              of some
              of our features. We may anonymize your Personal Information and Children's Personal Information so that
              you cannot
              be individually identified, and provide that information to our partners. The Children's Personal
              Information you
              provide shall only be used for creating your individual account (which will identify you within the user
              group(s)
              for which you have been granted an access code (“Limited Access Group”)), and for sending you
              notifications. You may
              modify or remove your Personal Information or Children's Personal Information identified below at any time
              by
              logging into your account and accessing features to edit your profile and/or account information. Please
              note that
              your school and/or district, can view all activity and content associated with your student account,
              including your
              Children's Personal Information. </p>
              <p> If you have provided us with a means of contacting you, we may use such means to communicate with you.
                For
                example, we may send you promotional offers on behalf of Asymmetrical.ai or other businesses (without
                sharing your
                Personal Information or Children's Personal Information), or communicate with you about your use of the
                Services.
                Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open a message from us. This confirmation helps us make our
                communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive
                communications from
                us, please do not opt in to such communications or indicate your preference by sending us an email to
                this effect

              <p>Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive
                and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, “cookie”
                information, and the
                page you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your computer or mobile device that allow
                us to
                recognize your browser or mobile device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are
                visited and
                by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or mobile device to
                prevent or limit
                your computer or device's acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some
                of our
                features. Our analytics vendors and advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your computer or
                device, when
                you click on pages or ads that appear on the Services. For children or student users of our Services or
                the sections
                of our Services for such users, these ads will not contain any behaviorally-targeted advertising or
                track users for
                such purposes. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website, such third party may also transmit
                cookies to
                you. </p>
              <p> When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Website), we
                only use this
                data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. For example, this
                aggregate data
                tells us how often users use parts of the Services, so that we can make the Services appealing to as
                many users as
                possible. We may also provide this aggregate information to our partners; our partners may use such
                information to
                understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with
                an optimal
                experience. We do not disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you
                personally.
              </p>
              <h5 class="sub-title">III. Will Asymmetrical.ai Share Any of the Personal Information OR CHILDREN'S
                PERSONAL INFORMATION it Receives?</h5>
              <p>We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information or Children's Personal Information in personally
                identifiable form to anyone. We share your Personal Information and Children's Personal Information with
                third
                parties as described in Section II and in this Section: </p>
              <h6> A. Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites We Do Not Control: </h6>
              <p>In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we're affiliated with may sell items
                or provide services to you through the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize
                when an
                affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal
                Information
                with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. If
                you are a
                student/child user, we will not share your Children's Personal Information in connection with any
                commercial third
                party transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit
                Third Party
                Account Information to your Services profile or to automatically transmit information in your Services
                profile to
                your third party account. For adult users, we have no control over the policies and practices of third
                party
                websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction
                or service
                relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business' or websites' policies.
              </p>
              <h6>B. Agents:</h6>
              <p> We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information
                with them
                to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right
                to use the
                Personal Information or Children's Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to
                assist us. We
                also take steps to ensure that they agree to protect the Personal Information or Children's Personal
                Information
                shared with them. </p>
              <h6>C. User Profiles and Submissions:</h6>
              <p>Certain user profile information, including without limitation a user
                name, location, and any video or image content that such user has uploaded to the Services, may be
                displayed to
                other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for
                Asymmetrical.ai services.
                Your account privacy settings allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information or
                (if
                applicable) Children's Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user
                profile is
                visible to others. Any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal
                Information or (if
                applicable) Children's Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner
                other users
                can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be
                collected
                and used by others. Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or
                comments or
                upload images or videos through the Services and other users can contact you through messages and
                comments.
                Additionally, if you sign into the Services through a third party social networking site or service,
                your list of
                “friends” from that site or service may be automatically imported to the Services, and such “friends,”
                if they are
                also registered users of the Services, may be able to access certain non-public information you have
                entered in your
                Services user profile. Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site
                or service
                that are available to adult users. Some of the features above may not be made available to
                children/student users,
                or if they are, with additional moderation or the requirement that teachers/schools obtain the necessary
                verifiable
                consent from parents in advance of activating such features. </p>
              <h6>D. Business Transfers:</h6>
              <p>We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer
                information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our
                assets) are
                acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control,
                Personal
                Information and Children's Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by
                a third
                party, if permitted by applicable law. </p>
              <h6>E. Protection of Asymmetrical.ai and Others:</h6>
              <p>We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any
                information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply
                our
                conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Asymmetrical.ai,
                our employees, our
                users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud
                protection
                and credit risk reduction. </p>
              <h6>F. With Your Consent:</h6>
              <p>Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information or
                Children's Personal Information may be shared with third parties in personally identifiable form, and
                will be able
                to prevent the sharing of this information. In the case of Children's Personal Information, we will
                first obtain the
                prior verifiable consent of a parent or legal guardian, or require that the teacher/school do so. </p>
              <h5 class="sub-title">IV. Is Personal Information About me OR CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION Secure?
              </h5>
              <p> Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access your account via
                a third
                party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party
                site or
                service. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information and Children's
                Personal
                Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and
                limiting
                access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your
                account. We use
                industry-standard security techniques to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal
                Information and
                Children's Personal Information we hold in our records. While we may provide encryption technologies and
                use other
                reasonable precautions to protect confidential information and provide suitable security, we cannot
                guarantee
                complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may
                compromise the
                security of user information at any time. </p>
              <p> The Services may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or
                practices on
                other sites. When following a link to another site you should read that site's privacy policy. </p>
              <h5 class="sub-title">V. What personal information and children's personal information can I access? </h5>
              <p>Through your account
                settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you've provided
                to us: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Name and password</li>
                <li>Email address</li>
                <li>User profile information</li>
                <li>Content in your account</li>
              </ul>
              <p> The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change. If you have any
                questions
                about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at <a
                  href="mailto:hello@Asymmetrical.ai">hello@Asymmetrical.ai</a>.
              </p>
              <p> If you would like to request that Children's Personal Information regarding your child be updated or
                deleted (or,
                if you are a teacher, a child that is in your class) by the Services, or if you wish to request that we
                discontinue
                the further collection nor use of Children's Personal Information, please contact us at <a
                  href="mailto:hello@Asymmetrical.ai">hello@Asymmetrical.ai</a>.
                A minor student's participation in our Services, and the ability of a minor student to access the
                Services, will not be
                conditioned on that student providing more Children's Personal Information than is reasonably necessary
                for that
                participation or access. We will respond to a request made pursuant to this section within 30 days of
                our receipt of
                such request. To request removal of your Personal Information or Children's Personal Information from
                our public
                forums, contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@Asymmetrical.ai">hello@Asymmetrical.ai</a>. In some cases,
                we may not be
                able to remove your information, in which
                case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. </p>
              <h5 class="sub-title">VI. What Choices Do I Have?</h5>
              <p>You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some
                information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our special features. You
                may be able
                to add, update, or delete information as explained in Section V above. When you update information,
                however, we may
                maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. [You may request deletion of your account
                by sending an
                email with instructions.] Please note that some information may remain in our records after your
                deletion of such
                information from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your
                Personal
                Information and Children's Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that
                would
                identify you personally. </p>
              <h5 class="sub-title">VII. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h5>
              <p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of
                information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is
                used. If we
                make changes in the way we use Personal Information or Children's Personal Information, we will notify
                you by
                posting an announcement on our Website or sending you a message, and if necessary, obtain the prior
                verifiable
                consent of a parent or legal guardian. You are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when you use
                the Services
                after such changes have been first posted. VIII. Questions or Concerns </p>
              <br />
              <p> If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed
                message to
